Hi, I’m @Onifel.
I’m interested in frontend development (web/software), emerging technologies, and building accessible products.
Currently learning about machine learning and AI development, I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web and software development, as well as innovative ideas for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.
How to reach me: You can send me a message on Twitter (@Onifel), or reach out via email (onitsoafelana@gmail.com).
I’m a passionate coder who can write clean, functional, and maintainable code in multiple programming languages, even while eating a burrito!
